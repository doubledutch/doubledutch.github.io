*This article was updated on March 20, 2019 due to the [release of the DoubleDutch Developer Platform v2.0 tools](./tools-v2)*

See this [FAQ for non-engineers](./faq).

The DoubleDutch Developer Platform supports developing standalone extensions that can be hosted
within a DoubleDutch mobile app. Extensions are written in Javascript using the React Native
framework.

# Developer Environment

The developer environment is currently limited to run on a Mac.

You do not need to have a DoubleDutch developer account in order to start developing a new extension.
DoubleDutch extensions can be written and tested locally in the iOS or Android simulator without any
prior contact with DoubleDutch Engineering.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS]
- [Watchman] (`brew install watchman`)
- [XCode] (to run in iOS simulator). If you have not used XCode before, be sure to open it once to
  accept the EULA and allow it to install the command line developer tools, or simply run `sudo xcodebuild -license accept`
  from the command line.

## Getting Started

1. Install the `doubledutch` [command line tools][@doubledutch/cli]

```
npm i -g @doubledutch/cli
```

2. Create an empty folder for your project and initialize it.

```
cd ~/code/project
doubledutch init
```

This will populate that folder with a functioning React Native project setup to run as an extension
within the DoubleDutch mobile app. By default the name of the extension will match the current folder
name. In the example above, you can find the Javascript files for your project in
`~/code/project/mobile/src/`. The file `HomeView.js` is the root of your extension and has been
initialized with a simple "To do" style sample extension. This sample extension provides examples of
using useful DoubleDutch libraries such as [@doubledutch/rn-client] (used by all DoubleDutch extensions
built with React Native) and [@doubledutch/firebase-connector] (optional integration with Google Cloud
Platform's Firebase Realtime Database for easy backend development).

3. Run the sample code in the simulator. Set up the
   [DoubleDutch simulator](https://github.com/doubledutch/simulator) app for either iOS or Android.

```
cd ~/code/project/mobile
npm start
```

The Javascript packager will take a couple minutes to initialize the first time. After that, `⌘ R` in the
simulator will quickly reload your changes.

4. Make edits to the code in your favorite editor. <VSCode /><Atom /><Sublime />
   
5. Hit `⌘ R` in the simulator to refresh.  `⌘ D` for debugging with Chrome developer tools.

## Interacting with the DoubleDutch mobile app

The sample extension that is created for you when you run `doubledutch init` uses the [@doubledutch/rn-client]
library, which serves as a bridge between your extension and the mobile app it is hosted within.

```js
import client, { Avatar, TitleBar } from '@doubledutch/rn-client'
```

This bridge allows you to access key information about the current event in the mobile app as well as the
attendee that is logged in:

```js
client.getCurrentUser().then(currentUser => console.log(currentUser))
client.getCurrentEvent().then(currentEvent => console.log(currentEvent))
```

In the simulator, mock data is provided for local development.

## Need a backend for your extension?

[@doubledutch/firebase-connector] provides optional integration with Google Cloud Platform's Firebase suite
for easy backend development. The default configuration provides access to realtime database references
in an environment managed by DoubleDutch. Each event's data is sandboxed, and [@doubledutch/firebase-connector]
provides database references that have various combinations of access control for attendees and event managers.
See [@doubledutch/firebase-connector] for more details.
